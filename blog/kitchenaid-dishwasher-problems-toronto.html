      <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> The most common KitchenAid dishwasher problems in Toronto are dishes not getting clean (clogged spray arms or weak wash pump), not draining (clogged filter assembly or failed drain pump), and error codes 6-1, 6-2, or 9-1 (water fill or heating element faults). Fixlify Appliance Services repairs KitchenAid dishwashers same-day — call <a href="tel:+14375241053">(437) 524-1053</a>, Mon–Sat 8am–8pm.
    </div>

    <p>KitchenAid dishwashers are premium appliances found in renovated Toronto kitchens, new builds in Leslieville, and high-end condos across the GTA. They're generally reliable — but when they do fail, the repair requires specific knowledge of KitchenAid's (Whirlpool-platform) design and error code system.</p>

    <p>This guide covers the top KitchenAid dishwasher problems our Toronto technicians see most, with DIY checks, error code explanations, and repair costs in 2026.</p>

    <h2>Problem 1: Dishes Not Getting Clean</h2>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>Clogged Spray Arms</h3>
      <p>KitchenAid dishwashers use upper and lower spray arms with small holes that can clog with lime scale and food debris. When clogged, water pressure drops and dishes in certain zones don't get cleaned. DIY fix: remove the spray arms (they twist off), rinse them under hot water, and poke a toothpick through any blocked holes. If cleaning doesn't restore pressure, the wash pump may need replacement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>Failed Wash Pump or Motor</h3>
      <p>The wash pump forces water through the spray arms at high pressure. When the motor bearings wear out or the impeller cracks, water pressure drops significantly — dishes look like they were just rinsed, not washed. Signs: a hissing or grinding noise during the wash cycle, or noticeably poor cleaning performance. Wash pump replacement: $200–$340.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>Water Temperature Too Low</h3>
      <p>KitchenAid recommends inlet water temperature of at least 120°F (49°C) for proper cleaning. If your Toronto home's hot water heater is set too low, or if the dishwasher's heating element has failed, water temperature won't be sufficient to activate detergent enzymes and remove grease. Test: run the kitchen faucet until it's hot before starting the dishwasher. If cleaning improves, check your water heater setpoint. If not, the dishwasher's heating element may have failed (error code 9-1).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Problem 2: Not Draining</h2>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>Clogged Filter Assembly (DIY Fix)</h3>
      <p>KitchenAid dishwashers have a two-part filter system at the tub floor — a coarse screen and a fine cylindrical filter. These must be cleaned monthly. Remove the lower rack, twist and lift the cylindrical filter, remove the flat screen beneath it, and rinse both under hot water with a brush. Reinstall and run a rinse cycle. This resolves drain problems in many cases at no cost.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>Failed Drain Pump</h3>
      <p>If the filter is clean but the dishwasher still won't drain (water sitting in the bottom after the cycle), the drain pump motor has likely failed. You may hear humming or silence where a drain noise should be. Drain pump replacement: $180–$300. On KitchenAid models, the drain pump is accessed from the front after removing the door panel — a job for a technician.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Problem 3: Not Starting or Mid-Cycle Stops</h2>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>Door Latch Failure</h3>
      <p>KitchenAid dishwashers require a fully engaged door latch to run. A worn latch doesn't send the start signal to the control board — the dishwasher appears unresponsive. This is especially common on KitchenAid models with the third rack (KDTE series) where the door is slightly heavier. Door latch replacement: $130–$200.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>Control Board Failure</h3>
      <p>The control board governs every dishwasher function. When it fails, the dishwasher may not respond to button presses, stop mid-cycle randomly, or display persistent error codes. Control board replacement: $250–$420. For KitchenAid models under 5 years old, it's worth checking if the board is covered under extended warranty — contact KitchenAid Canada.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>Reset tip:</strong> To reset a KitchenAid dishwasher and clear minor error codes, press Cancel/Drain and hold for 3 seconds. If the error code returns after a full cycle, the underlying component needs replacement — resetting won't fix a hardware fault.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <p class="faq-q">What are common KitchenAid dishwasher problems?</p>
      <p>The most common issues are: dishes not clean (spray arm or pump), not draining (filter or drain pump), door latch failure, and error codes 6-1, 7-1, 9-1 (fill, heating, diverter faults). Most are repairable same-day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <p class="faq-q">How much does KitchenAid dishwasher repair cost in Toronto?</p>
      <p>Spray arm cleaning $0 (DIY), drain pump $180–$300, door latch $130–$200, control board $250–$420. Fixlify includes 90-day warranty on all repairs. Call (437) 524-1053.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <p class="faq-q">What does error code 6-1 mean on a KitchenAid dishwasher?</p>
      <p>6-1 (F6E1) means the water fill sensor is not detecting water correctly. The float switch or water inlet valve is typically the cause. Both are repairable same-day. Call Fixlify at (437) 524-1053.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <p class="faq-q">Is KitchenAid dishwasher repair worth it in Toronto?</p>
      <p>Yes — for units under 8 years old, repair almost always makes sense. KitchenAid dishwashers cost $1,200–$2,500 to replace new, while most repairs cost $130–$340. Even a control board ($250–$420) is far less than replacement.</p>
