  <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Bosch dishwasher not draining? The most common causes are a clogged filter, blocked drain pump, or kinked drain hose. Error code E24 or E25 points to a drainage fault. <a href="tel:+14375241053">(437) 524-1053</a> — Fixlify Appliance Services, same-day Bosch repair across Toronto, Mon&ndash;Sat 8am&ndash;8pm. Repair cost: $130&ndash;$320.
</div>

<p>Bosch dishwashers are among the quietest and most reliable in the industry — and one of the most common brands we repair across Toronto's renovated kitchens. When a Bosch dishwasher stops draining, it nearly always shows error code E24 or E25, and the bottom of the tub fills with standing water after the cycle.</p>

<p>Our Bosch-experienced technicians have resolved hundreds of Bosch drainage faults in Toronto homes since 2017, from Roncesvalles bungalows to Trinity Bellwoods row houses to King West condos. Here is everything you need to know before you call.</p>

<h2>Understanding Bosch Error Codes E24 and E25</h2>
<p>Bosch dishwashers use specific error codes to communicate drainage problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>E24:</strong> Water is not draining — pump, hose, or filter blockage</li>
  <li><strong>E25:</strong> Drain pump is blocked or the filter mesh is clogged with debris</li>
  <li><strong>E17:</strong> Too much water in the machine (often caused by partial drainage failure)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both E24 and E25 require the same investigation: filter, pump, and drain hose. Do not continue running cycles when these codes appear — it stresses the drain pump motor and can cause a more expensive secondary failure.</p>

<h2>The 5 Causes of Bosch Dishwasher Drainage Failure</h2>

<div class="issue-card">
  <h3>1. Clogged Filter Assembly (Most Common)</h3>
  <p>The Bosch filter system consists of a mesh cylindrical filter and a flat microfilter at the bottom of the tub. Food particles, glass chips, and debris accumulate in both. Bosch recommends monthly cleaning, but most Toronto homeowners go years without cleaning it. A heavily clogged filter is the cause in approximately 40% of drainage calls we receive.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:8px"><strong>DIY fix:</strong> Remove the lower rack, twist and lift the cylindrical filter counterclockwise, remove the flat filter beneath it, and rinse both under running water. Use a soft brush to clear the mesh. Reassemble and run a rinse cycle. If E24 clears, the filter was the issue.</p>
</div>

<div class="issue-card">
  <h3>2. Blocked Drain Hose</h3>
  <p>The drain hose runs from the drain pump to the drain under your kitchen sink. It can become kinked during installation, blocked with grease buildup, or partially blocked where it connects to the sink drain or air gap. A high loop or air gap that is not installed correctly also causes drainage issues in Bosch dishwashers.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:8px"><strong>Check:</strong> Pull the dishwasher slightly forward and inspect the drain hose for sharp bends or kinks. Also check the connection at the sink drain or disposal for blockage.</p>
</div>

<div class="issue-card">
  <h3>3. Faulty Drain Pump</h3>
  <p>The drain pump physically forces water out through the drain hose. When it fails mechanically (worn impeller, seized motor) or electrically (burned-out coil), water remains in the tub. You may hear a humming sound at the end of a cycle if the pump motor is trying to run but cannot expel water.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:8px"><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> After cleaning the filter, run a short cycle and listen at the end. A running pump sound with no drainage indicates a failed pump rather than a clog. This requires professional pump replacement.</p>
</div>

<div class="issue-card">
  <h3>4. Garbage Disposal Knockout Plug</h3>
  <p>If your Bosch was recently installed and has never drained properly, and you have a garbage disposal, the disposal's dishwasher inlet knockout plug may not have been removed during installation. This plug must be knocked out before connecting the dishwasher drain hose. New installations that drain immediately after setup are the giveaway.</p>
</div>

<div class="issue-card">
  <h3>5. Control Board or Sensor Fault</h3>
  <p>Less commonly, the control board misreads a water level sensor and stops the drain cycle early, or the drain pump relay on the board fails. This is the rarest cause and is typically only suspected after the filter, hose, and pump have been confirmed functional.</p>
</div>

<h2>What You Can Try Before Calling a Technician</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Clean the filter</strong> (cylindrical + flat mesh) — takes 5 minutes</li>
  <li><strong>Check the drain hose</strong> for kinks or disconnection at the sink</li>
  <li><strong>Run a drain cycle reset:</strong> On most Bosch models, hold the Start button for 3 seconds to initiate a drain-only cycle</li>
  <li><strong>Check the air gap</strong> (if installed) — remove the cap and clear any debris</li>
</ol>
<p>If E24 persists after these steps, or if you can hear the pump motor running but water is not moving, call for professional service. The pump or hose requires hands-on inspection.</p>

<h2>Why Bosch Dishwasher Repairs Require Specialist Experience</h2>
<p>Bosch dishwashers have a more complex filter and pump assembly than North American brands like Whirlpool or GE. The filter is a multi-piece system that requires correct reassembly — incorrect filter seating causes air ingestion that mimics a drainage fault. The drain pump is also accessed differently than in most other brands, requiring removal of the lower spray arm assembly and sump cover.</p>
<p>Our technicians are experienced specifically with Bosch SHP, SHX, and SHEM series dishwashers, which are the most common Bosch models installed in Toronto homes.</p>

<div class="tip-box">
  <strong>Preventive maintenance:</strong> Clean your Bosch filter monthly. Run a cleaning cycle with a Bosch-approved dishwasher cleaner quarterly. This prevents 80% of drainage problems and keeps the dishwasher running quietly for its full 15+ year service life.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">Why is my Bosch dishwasher not draining and showing E24?</div>
  <p>E24 means the dishwasher cannot drain. Start by cleaning the filter assembly (cylindrical + flat filter at the bottom of the tub). If E24 clears after cleaning, the filter was the cause. If it persists, the drain pump or hose requires professional inspection.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">Can I fix a Bosch E24 error myself?</div>
  <p>Yes, if the cause is a clogged filter. Remove and clean the filter, then run a drain cycle. If E24 persists after filter cleaning, the repair requires professional diagnosis and likely drain pump replacement — not a DIY repair for most homeowners.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">How much does Bosch dishwasher drain repair cost in Toronto?</div>
  <p>Bosch dishwasher drain repair in Toronto typically costs $130 to $320. A simple filter clean and blockage clear costs $130 to $180. Drain pump replacement costs $220 to $320. Our $119 diagnostic fee is waived when you proceed with repair.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">Do you carry Bosch drain pumps on your service van?</div>
  <p>Yes. We stock drain pumps for Bosch SHP, SHX, SHEM, and SHPM series dishwashers — the most common Bosch models installed in Toronto. This allows same-day completion for most Bosch drain pump replacements without a return visit.</p>
