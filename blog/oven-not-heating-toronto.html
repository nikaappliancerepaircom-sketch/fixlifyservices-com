      <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> An oven that won't heat is most commonly caused by a failed bake element (electric ovens) or a dead igniter (gas ovens). You can often see bake element failure by looking — a visible break or burn mark on the coil confirms it. Gas igniter failure is diagnosed by watching the igniter glow: if it glows red but no flame appears, the igniter is too weak to open the gas valve.

    <p>Whether you're preparing dinner for your family in a Leslieville semi or hosting guests in a Bloor West condo, an oven that refuses to heat is a serious inconvenience. The good news: oven heating problems are among the most straightforward appliance repairs — most are diagnosed and fixed in a single visit.</p>

    <p>This guide covers every cause of an oven not heating, separated by electric and gas models, with Toronto repair costs and guidance on what you can check yourself before calling.</p>

    <h2>Electric Oven Not Heating — 4 Causes</h2>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>1. Failed Bake Element (Most Common — Electric)</h3>
      <p>The bake element is the thick coil at the bottom of your electric oven. It draws significant current to heat the oven cavity and is subject to thermal stress every time the oven is used. When it fails, it often breaks visibly — you can see a gap, a blister, or a burn hole in the coil. Turn on the oven and watch the element: a working element begins glowing orange within 2 minutes. No glow, or sparking at a break point, confirms element failure.</p>
      <p><strong>Repair cost:</strong> Bake element replacement $140–$250 including labour. Most major brand elements are a 30-minute swap.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>2. Broken Broil Element</h3>
      <p>Some electric ovens use both the bake element and broil element together in bake mode (dual-element baking). If the broil element (at the top of the cavity) fails, baking temperatures may be insufficient even if the bake element is functional. If your oven heats slowly, doesn't reach set temperature, or the top of dishes never browns, the broil element may be the cause. Broil element replacement: $130–$220.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>3. Faulty Oven Temperature Sensor</h3>
      <p>The oven temperature sensor (a thin probe protruding from the back wall of the oven cavity) tells the control board the actual oven temperature. If the sensor fails or its resistance drifts out of spec, the control board may think the oven is already at temperature and cut the element too early — resulting in an oven that runs cool or not at all. Testing requires a multimeter (measure resistance at 70°F — should be approximately 1,080 ohms for most brands). Temperature sensor replacement: $130–$210.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>4. Control Board or Relay Board Failure</h3>
      <p>The main control board contains relays that switch power to the bake and broil elements. When a relay fails in the open position, the element receives no power. Control board failures are more common on ovens over 8 years old, on ranges with electronic touchpad controls, and after power surges (Toronto experiences significant spring storm-related power events). Control board replacement: $280–$480 depending on the brand and model.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Gas Oven Not Heating — 3 Causes</h2>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>1. Weak or Failed Gas Igniter (Most Common — Gas)</h3>
      <p>Gas ovens use a glow-bar igniter to open the gas safety valve. The igniter must reach a specific current draw (about 3.2–3.6 amps) to open the valve. As igniters age, they draw less current — they glow but never get hot enough to open the valve. The diagnostic: turn on the oven and watch the igniter through the broiler drawer. If the igniter glows for 90 seconds or more without lighting, it is weak and needs replacement. A healthy igniter lights gas within 30–45 seconds.</p>
      <p><strong>Repair cost:</strong> Gas igniter replacement $160–$280 including parts and labour.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>2. Gas Safety Valve Failure</h3>
      <p>The gas safety valve stays closed until the igniter heats up sufficiently. If the valve itself fails (stuck closed), gas won't flow even with a properly functioning igniter. This is less common than igniter failure but does occur on older ranges and after the appliance has been without power for extended periods. The diagnostic distinction: if the igniter glows hot (lights within 30–45 seconds) but no flame appears, the valve is suspect. Gas valve replacement: $220–$380.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>3. Gas Supply Issue</h3>
      <p>Before calling for service, confirm the gas supply is reaching the oven. Check that the gas shut-off valve behind the range is fully open (handle parallel to the pipe = open). Confirm that the stove burners light normally — if they do, gas is flowing to the appliance and the issue is oven-specific. If burners also don't light, the gas supply line or meter may be the issue — contact Enbridge or your gas utility.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>Error code tip:</strong> Many modern ranges display error codes when heating components fail. F1, F3, F10, and similar codes on Whirlpool/Maytag ranges often indicate sensor or control board issues. Samsung ranges show SE, 5E, E-84 for sensor and element faults. Note any error code and provide it when calling — it speeds up diagnosis and parts preparation.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <p class="faq-q">Why is my oven not heating in Toronto?</p>
      <p>For electric ovens, a failed bake element is the most common cause — look for a visible break or burn mark on the coil at the oven floor. For gas ovens, a weak igniter that glows but doesn't light the gas burner within 45 seconds is most common. Both are fixable same-day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <p class="faq-q">Can I see if the bake element is broken?</p>
      <p>Yes — inspect the bake element (thick coil at the oven floor) with the oven unplugged. A visible gap, hole, or burn mark on the coil confirms failure. Turn the oven on briefly and watch: a working element glows orange within 2 minutes. No glow = failed element.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <p class="faq-q">How much does oven repair cost in Toronto?</p>
      <p>Bake element replacement $140–$250, gas igniter $160–$280, temperature sensor $130–$210, control board $280–$480. Fixlify Appliance Services provides 90-day warranty on all repairs. Call (437) 524-1053 for same-day service.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <p class="faq-q">Is it worth repairing an oven in Toronto or should I replace it?</p>
      <p>If the oven is under 10 years old, repair almost always makes financial sense — a new mid-range range costs $900–$1,800, while most oven repairs cost $140–$280. Even a control board replacement ($280–$480) is far less than replacement. Our technicians give you an honest repair-vs-replace assessment at diagnosis.</p>
